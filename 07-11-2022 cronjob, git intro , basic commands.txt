Agenda :
-------------
1.cronjob
2.Git intro
3.types of version control system
4.repository
5.some basic commands 


1.Cron job :
----------------
For example we will be having alarm 

Scenario:
--------------------------
when we are working developer will tell build will be deploying at morning 5AM 
but at that time tester will be not avilable

they will set the cron for testing at morning 5AM it will automatically run the tests

at the specified time cron is going execute that task 

Sheduling the jobs 

How to shedule the jobs:-
-----------------------------------
step 1 :- we need write a shell script for sheduling the jobs

nano cron.sh 


#!/bin/bash

date >> /home/ec2-user/shellscripting/wddm9.txt

step 2 :- we need to shedule the job 


crontab -e is nothing but crontab is the operation which we are performing 

what are the task we are going to execute that things we need specify

crontab -e    


* * * * * /home/ec2-user/shellscripting/cron.sh

* * * * *  :- each and every miniute 

i am executing the cron.sh file for each and every min when ever the cron.sh file will get execute at that time
the output of the file needs to store inside the wddm9.txt file 
===========================================================================

GIT :-
------------------------
Git is a distributed version control system

what is version control system???...

A version control system is a system that maintains different versions of our project . when we work in 
team or an individual as the project progresses new features will get added ..

so version control system maintains the different versions of system..

example :--------------

whatsapp :chats--v1
          chats,calls--v2
          chats,status,calls---v3
          chats,status,calls,payment---v4-------------this new feature is not working at that time 
                                          we can roll back to older version  by using version control system

in version control system we will be having 3 types :
---------------------------------------------------------
1.local version control system
2.centralised version control system
3.Distributed version control system:


1.local version control system:
--------------------------------------
we will be writing the source code in our local system if any thing happes to that system
we lost all the work what and all we did ..............

drawback :- if anything happens to the system the data will be completely lost...

to overcome the drawback of local version control system we will be having centralized version control system

2.centralized version control system:
----------------------------------------
drawback :

in anything happens to the central server the data will be lost

and for working we required good internet .....

to overcome the drawback of this we will having distributed version control system

3.Distributed version control system:
-------------------------------------------

==================================================================================
git bash is just terminal 

we can execute our git commands anywhere but only one requiremnt the system needs to get installed with git 

working the git we will be 2 options 

1.we can create the repositroy in our local system then we can coonect it with remote

2.we can create repo in remote then we can clone it local system

GITHUB :
----------------------
Github is basically is a for profit company owned by micrsoft, which hosts git repositroy online.....


1.working directory 

touch <file >


2.staging area (it is an area where we first need to put our project before commiting, this is used for code 
review by other team members )

git add <file>

3.local repo


4.remote repo 
=============================================================================================
1.git clone :- it is used to copy the remote repositroy to our local system

already repository is present and working is going on in middle of the project we are joined to the comapny
at that time we will be doing this job.................

cd <repo-name>

touch <file>

2.git status :- it is used to check the status of the branch, to check whether the files are in tracking or 
                 untracking mode...


we are working in the repo 

3.git add <file> it is used to add the files to stagging area.


4.git commit -m "msg" :- By using this we will storing the chnages as well as we are creating the versions of the 
                         file...(creating the snapshot)
                        

5.git config --global user.name "user-name"

6.git config --global user.email "mail-id"

7.git log :- it is used to check the commit history

8.git push origin <brnach-name> :- it is used to add the local changes to remote..

9.git fetch origin <branch-name> :- it is used to check the recent changes in remote which is done by other 
                                        developers

when we fetch the data will be present inside the .git repo

the data will be present inside the .git repo

cd .git

cd FETCH_HEAD


10.git pull origin <branch-name> :- it is used to download the remote changes to local system...
