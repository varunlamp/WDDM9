User management :
--------------------------
like our AWS account---IAM roles users

jenkins --- users and will attach the roles for the users based on the position/requirement

example :- Dev :- Build (will attach the role he can able create the jobs,modify)

test :- read permission for the respective user

To attach the roles to the user we required role based authorization strategy

Creating the user and attaching the roles :
-------------------------------------------------------
1.manage jenkins
2.manage plugins
3.Available-role based authorization strategy

4.manage jenkins
5.users--create users
6.add the user details& confirm

7.Configure global security
8.Authorization
9.Role based strategy

10.manage & assign roles
11.manage roles
12.roles (add the permissions)
13.assign roles 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
can we change the GUI of the jenkins????

-> yes we can change the GUI by installing the plugin called blue ocen

Install the Blue Ocean plugin


Jenkins Backup :
----------------------
1.manage jenkins---manage plugins--avaiable ---ThinBackup

2.manage jenkins --- tools and actions ---ThinBackup

3.ThinBackup---settings ---add the path --save 
(give the persmission  for the dir (chmod 777 <file>))

4.click on backup --check it in the path

SDLC :- Software development life cycle 

Def:-
Software development life cycle is a step by step or standard procedure to develop a 
new software 

when it will get start :
-------------------------
when a company / person gets a project then they will start with SDLC.

why we need follow the SDLC??
------------------------------------
1.we will not get know how much money needs to invested 

2.how many eng needs to work on the project

3.we will get the supporting documentation for the project

4.if we are not having the certain plan we will not get to know when we need to complte

we will be delaying the release 

DEVOPS --

Stages :
------------------
1.Requirment collection
2.Feasibility study
3.Design
4.Developing
5.Testing
6.Installation
7.Maintance 


Example :- House construction 

1.House construction company 

1.Requirment collection :- (BA/PA)
(service based--BA
 product based --PA)
BA :- bussiness analsyst --collect the requirment from the customer 

need one hall -- TV,pop,Bathroom
kitchen :---------

2.Feasibility study:
-------------------------
PM(project manager)
Architect--- lang,design 
HR
finance team 
BA

they will plan ---bugdet 

3.Design :- (HLD&LLD) arch - technical arch, sr arch, arch 

HLD :- high level design (blue print )

LLD :- low level Design ( we will be having deatiled planning of the house)

4.Developing : sr dev, jr dev, fresher 
-----------------
according to the LLD they will start  build 

5.testing :- sr test, jr test, fresher 
-----------------------
Quality of the building and we will be testing the 

6.Installation : installtion eng, site eng 
-------------------


7.Mainatnce :------- dev & test 
-----------------------------

Types of SDLC modules :
--------------------------
1.waterfall model

stages :
--------------
1.Requirment collection
2.Feasibility study
3.Design
4.Developing
5.Testing
6.Installation
7.Maintance 

2.spiral model :-
---------------

stages :

1.Requirment collection
2.Feasibility study
3.Design
4.Developing
5.Testing
6.Installation
7.Maintance 


stage -- features 
3.V & V model (verification & Validation)--dev & test simul and each and every step is tested 

1.Requirment collection
2.Feasibility study
3.Design
4.Developing
5.Testing
6.Installation
7.Maintance 

4.Prototype model

stages :
---------------
1.Requirment collection
2.Feasibility study

3.Design -- demo design(prototype of the project )
4.Developing
5.Testing
6.Installation
7.Maintance 
 
5.Hybrid model :-
----------------------

here we will combine the modules (v&v with prototype)
spiral with prototype

6.Derived model :-

waterfall model -- v&v module 

7.Agile model:
------------------------
Agile is a itterative and incremental approach where customer can change thier reuirement
anytime 

as a company we have to flexible enough to accept (take up ) the chnages ,

develop and test the changes and we need to delivery the software with short span of time

or planned period of time....

*) Advantage of agile :
---------------------------------
1.the main aim of agile is to satisfy the customer by giving quality s/w with in short span of time
2.Reuirement changes are allowed
3.Easy model to adopt
4.there will be good communication between dev, test eng BA & scrum master, customer 
5.Release are short
6.Dev & Test eng can communicat with customer & take the feedback from customer 

*) DisAdvantage of agile :
--------------------------------
1.Scope of design and documentation is less
2.Experience resource are required to work
3.if customer not avare of complete requirment chances are there we might missup the requirment


Agile terminology :-
-------------------------
1.Release :- Combination of 1 or more sprint 
2.sprint :- Sprint is a actial time taken by developers and test eng to dev and test the software
3.Story :- Features/module/functionality
4.Epic :- Complete / set of requirment
5.story point :- rough estimation given by the dev and test eng to dev and test the software
in terms of Day 

Fibonacci series :

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 

6.swag :- rough estimation given by the dev and test to dev and TE the s/w in terms of 
           hours 


Scrum module :-
--------------
It is a step by step procedure / standard procedure which helps team work together to dev new
software.

Meetings :--
--------------------
1.sprint planning
2.scrum meetings
3.sprint reterospective meeting.
4.release Reterospective
5.bug trigen /defect trigen
6.product backlog /sprint review 


Scrum master :-BA/dev/test/
-----------------------
scrum master is a person who is responsible for delivery of software to the customer within 
planned period of time...
